# LumenFold Protocol (LFP-0)

**Source-Layer Transparency Standard derived from Transparent Boundary Theory (TPT)**  
DOI: https://zenodo.org/records/17170799  

LumenFold Protocol (LFP-0) provides a *source-layer transparency* interface for stabilizing intention,
meaning-clarity, and semantic boundaries between humans and AI systems.

It is not an NLP model.  
It is a semantic-protocol layer designed to reduce ambiguity, subjective-weight drift, cross-cultural
misalignment, and pre-execution errors.

## 🌐 Overview

LumenFold Protocol enables:

- **Multi-agent alignment** (Grok, xAI, AGI-oriented agents)  
- **xAI / Grok intention-clarification**
- **FSD stack → language → behavior alignment membrane**
- **AI ↔ human semantic boundary minimization**
- **Reduction of subjective weight & cultural drift**
- **Execution-path clarity before action**

This creates a *clarity membrane* between:
- raw language  
- conceptual intent  
- executable meaning

## 💬 What LumenFold is **not**

💬 **Field evidence.**  
For Zenodo releases and frontier-lab interactions around LFP-0,  
see the [LumenFold evidence log](./evidence.md)

❌ Not a neural network  
❌ Not a training dataset  
❌ Not a replacement for LLMs  
❌ Not a philosophical thesis

LFP-0 is a **semantic-protocol**, similar to:
- Internet protocols → HTTP  
- Encryption protocols → TLS  
- Agent coordination layers → ROS  

Except this one operates at the **language-intention layer**.
