## ⚙️ Intended Applications

### 1. **Multi-Agent Coordination**  
Provides a stable semantic layer for agents to:
- share intent  
- avoid drift  
- negotiate meaning  

### 2. **Human ↔ AI Meaning Alignment**  
For command systems (FSD, robotics, agents):
- prevents ambiguity before task execution  
- stabilizes “intention → action” mapping  

### 3. **C3 Communication Layer**  
LFP-0 supports *post-subjective communication*, meaning:
- language without heavy personal bias  
- cross-civilizational clarity  
- transparent meaning flow
